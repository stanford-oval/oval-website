            The Open Virtual Assistant Lab Researchers will use and develop open-source software,
            and it is the intention of all Open Virtual Assistant Lab Program researchers that any
            software released will be released under an open source model, such as BSD. The Program is
            open to all Stanford faculty who share this goal.
